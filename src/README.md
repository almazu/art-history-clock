## Usage
A user opens the Art History Clock web page. They see the time and appreciate the artwork. They want more information about said
artwork and proceed to click the appropriate 'Artwork info' link which directs them to the WikiArt web page for that painting. 
Moving on, they remember they have an appointment later in the day and decide to set an alarm for 4:00 p.m. By clicking the text 
box at the bottom of the page a calendar and times of the day pop up. Once the time is chosen they click 'Set'. An alert box notifies
the user the alarm has been set. The user clicks 'Ok' and continues to appreciate the artwork before continuing on with their day.
